# LisaTextEditor
This my first app using Python. And I done this with the help of some websites such as You-Tube, Stackoverflow, Geeks for geeks etc..... So there may be some issues. But don't worry this app is working good. And it is similar to Notepad++. But in this app, the only language you  can use is Python. Because I did not setup the syntax highlining effect to other programming languages. So enjoy my app.


*You can use this script to,
  Python(Main porpose of building this script)
  PHP
  HTML(You can't open html files. Just to write them only.)
  CSS
  and etc....

*This script hase some additional comments. So if you dont need them, Just can clear them.

*If you convert this script to an exe, the file will be taken approximately 112MB in size. But it will use low ram usage(Good for Python).
