This my first app using Python. And I done this with the help of some websites such as You-Tube, Stackoverflow, Geeks for geeks etc..... So there may be some issues. But don't worry this app is working good. And it is similar to Notepad++. But in this app, the only language you  can use is Python. Because I did not setup the syntax highlining effect to other programming languages. So enjoy my app.


<h5>*You can use this script to,</h5>
 1) Python(Main porpose of building this script)<br>
 2) PHP<br>
 3) HTML(You can't open html files. Just to write them only.)<br>
 4) CSS codes<br>
  and etc....<br>


*This script hase some additional comments. So if you dont need them, Just can clear them.

*If you convert this script to an exe, the file will be taken approximately 112MB in size. But it will use low ram usage(Good for Python).
